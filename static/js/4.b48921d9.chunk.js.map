Also, (Thank you StarCraft and your direct dial-up network feature) I learned basics of computer hardware, and networking.</p>\n\t\t<h3>Middle school</h3>\n\t\t<p>Unfortunatly, when I went to middle school, my family moved to another place, and a new school I had very low-level CS-class, so I had to educate myself, it was hard and inconvenient because this period in my home town (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskemen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" >Ust'-Kamenogorks</a>) Internet connection was a rear thing, and I had only 3 options: books, magazines, and prepaid internet cards for low-speed dial-up connection (a rare, and not a popular option for me). So, mostly, I liked to read magazines, because they also included CDs or DVDs with software and OS's (Linux or FreeBSD - this is how I've got into Linux-world) on it.\n        In 2009 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_digital_subscriber_line\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" >ADSL</a>-internet-provider has came to my city, and I've got my first unlimited internet connection - and it speeded up my progress a lot! I've learned basics of HTML, CSS, and PHP, I was playing with open-source web and database servers, but in 2011 my family had to move far away. \n        </p>\n\t\t<h3>High school and University</h3>\n\t\t<p>At my graduate class I had to prepare for certain exams on my own because I wanted to enroll to the highest-ranked <a href=\"http://www.tu-bryansk.ru/content/obs/hist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" >university</a> in my region, and I had to get good grades on the final exams, and my school could not give me the necessary level of preparation for my future university.\n        Part of this exams is computer science exam, which has programming part, and to prepare for this exam I used to programming in school at history, and social theory classes, I had no laptop, so I installed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)\" target=\"_blank\"  rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" >Pascal</a> compiler on my small android-smartphone, and was taping for 2 years at school :D, (also I showed this compiler, and how to start coding to a friend of mine, and he successfully passed and enrolled to my university too, but this credit goes to him because he spent so much time coding on his smartphone).\n        So, a smartphone is a great thing! :D \n        </p>\n\t\t<p>After school graduation, I passed necessary exams, and enrolled to BSTU (Bryansk State Technical University) Information Technologies Department, and have studied Computer Science and Software for 1 year, where I got a lot of friends, and it was fun!\n        Then, my family got a green card and I had to drop my education, and move to The Unites States</p>\n\t\t<h3>Portland, Oregon</h3>\n\t\t<p>When I've got to Portland, I had strange feeling.</p>\n        <p>Friends of my family were helping us at that moment, they wanted to take us to a beach in our first day in the US, and while we were driving through the city, we stopped at one computer shop, and friends introduced me to the owner of this shop (Shops - if To be more precise), and I've got my first job on my first day (and hours) in the US :D\n        </p>\n\t\t<em>\"to be continued\"</em>\n\t\t<h3 className=\"\">My journey! <span style={{fontSize: \"14px\"}}>(hint: {isMobile? \"hold your finger couple seconds over any marker\":\"hover the cursor over any marker\"})</span></h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<MapComponent/>\n\n\t\t<span><em>1999: In my childhood, I had a lot of toys, and electric devices (like cassette player), one day I've found a screwdriver <img className=\"emoji\" src=\"https://cdn.emojidex.com/emoji/seal/%28flat_head%29screw_driver.png\" alt=\"\"/>, and after a couple of hours, my parents found me on the floor surrounded by numbers of details</em></span>\n\t\t<br/>\n\t\t<br/>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t);\n}\n\nexport default AboutMe; "],"sourceRoot":""}
